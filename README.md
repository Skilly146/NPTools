# NPTools
This repo is a collection of some of the tools I have made for Neptune's Pride. They are all written in Python, which you can install [here](https://www.python.org/)
* Circular Team PlacerNP: A python script that places players in a circular galaxy in groups, with extra spacing between each group. It is designed to group players into teams, but if you set padding to 0 it can also be used to make a circular galaxy with custom distances
* Triangular Team PlacerNP: A python script that places players along a triangular grid adjacent to a set amount of teammates. 
* Team Tracker: A python script that can add up the star count of all the players on a team and rank them. Put people on teams by putting the team number before their alias

You should only need to change the configuration variables at the beginning of the file, so if something isn't working feel free to DM me on discord at Skilly146#2745
