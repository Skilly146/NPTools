# NPTools
This repo is a collection of some of the tools I have made for Neptune's Pride. They are all written in Python, which you can install [here](https://www.python.org/)
* Circular Team PlacerNP: A python script that places players in a circular galaxy in groups, with extra spacing between each group. It is designed to group players into teams, but if you set padding to 0 it can also be used to make a circular galaxy with custom distances
* Triangular Team PlacerNP: A python script that places players along a triangular grid adjacent to a set amount of teammates.
